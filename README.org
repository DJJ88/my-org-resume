* Creating a CV/Resume in Org-Mode using LaTeX Templates :emacs:org_mode:cv:resume:doom_emacs:

It was recently brough to my attention that my cv was not very
appealing. I pondered upon this comments a little bit more and started
searching for a different way to present my profile. I have stumbled
upon this solution by [[https://github.com/aidanscannell/my-org-resume][aidan scannell]], who uses org-mode to built his
cv.
